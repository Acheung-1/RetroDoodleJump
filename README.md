Group members:
-   Andrew Cheung

To run the game, run the script main.py. You will be presented with a window and a prompt to start the game.

Controls:
-   Left/Right - Move to the side
-   Spacebar - Jump

Some random ideas that can be added:
-   Ending the game
    -   We can stop if we fall below a certain topscore (like 100 for example)
-   Randomly generated platforms
-   Fake platforms
-   Platforms disappearing after some time
-   Add difficulty
